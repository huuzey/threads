Threads app with some functionalities implemented.
1.Authentication by using Clerk with Google, Github and username and email.
2.You can add threads one you are signed in, give a comment on the thread.
3.Create communities, add members, remove a member.
4.Edit any of your profile inputs.
6.Absolutely mobile, tablets and desktop responsive website.
7.Tech stacks: Next.Js, React.js, Typescript, Mongo DB, Shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS, Zod(validation of the inputs), Clerk(Authentication), Uploadthing.com(Image Upload),
              React-hook-form(form inputs).
8.I also can add functionalities of liking a thread and the like but nothing worths rather wasting of time because I did a lot of like functionalities before.

              Thanks a lot!!!
